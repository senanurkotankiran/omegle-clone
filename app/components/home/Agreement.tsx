        Omegle (oh`meg`ull) is a great way to meet new friends. When you use Omegle, you are paired randomly with another person to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you’ll be randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same interests. To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not recommended!), and you can stop a chat at any time.
